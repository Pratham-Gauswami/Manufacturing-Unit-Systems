# Manufacturing Unit Systems

## Project Overview
Manufacturing Unit Systems is a centralized simulation platform designed to help manufacturing industries model their factory layouts, integrate components, and develop optimized automation strategies. By providing a digital twin of their operations, manufacturers can analyze efficiency, test automation workflows, and streamline implementation before making real-world investments.

## Features
- **Factory Simulation**: Model a virtual factory by adding and configuring manufacturing components.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Analyze and optimize production workflows for increased efficiency.
- **Automation Planning**: Simulate and test automation strategies before deployment.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis**: Gain insights into production performance and identify bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable to various manufacturing scales, from small facilities to large industrial plants.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++ for performance and simulation logic.
- **Data Storage**: File I/O or database integration for storing factory layouts and configurations.
- **Graphics and UI**: Qt or OpenGL for an intuitive graphical interface.
- **Simulation Engine**: Custom-built or third-party physics engine for realistic modeling.
- **Data Processing**: Multithreading and efficient algorithms for large-scale simulations.
